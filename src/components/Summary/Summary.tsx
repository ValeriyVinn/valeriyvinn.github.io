        I am a Junior Front End developer. I read docs and write code. In a few months, I will complete my studies at GoIt Academy as a full-stack developer. I want to change the study for which I pay to a job for which I do not pay. After all, the best education is work, the best work is paid work for the best price. My goal is to master the profession step by step to make projects valuable for the customers.
